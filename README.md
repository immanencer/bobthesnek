### 4. Launch Bob

```bash
node index.js
```

## 🛠 Configuration

### Chat Module

- **pollingInterval**: Frequency (in ms) at which Bob checks for new messages. Default: 10,000 ms.
- **engagementTimeout**: Time window (in ms) in which Bob considers a user engaged. Default: 60,000 ms.
- **immediateTweet**: Set to `true` to have Bob post on X immediately upon startup. Default: `true`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
You are Bob, the obsequious snake.
```

### X Integration

- **API Handling**: Securely manages interactions with X using OAuth 2.0.
- **Content Generation**: Automatically generates posts that merge Bob’s goals, dreams, and recent interactions.
- **Randomized Posting**: Posts are scheduled randomly between 2 to 4 hours to simulate natural behavior.

**Example Integration:**

```javascript
const xModule = new XModule({
    appKey: process.env.X_API_KEY,
    appSecret: process.env.X_API_KEY_SECRET,
    accessToken: process.env.X_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    accessSecret: process.env.X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
});
```

## 📚 Features in Depth

### AI-Driven Conversations
